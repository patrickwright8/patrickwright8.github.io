<p style="font-size:20px">I have a deep interest in how computational methods (machine learning, statistical methods, optimization) can be applied to accelerate the design and discovery of materials. I'm especially excited about applications in drug discovery and the development of sustainable materials.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">I graduated from Tufts University in 2022 with a bachelor's in chemical engineering, where I researched how fouling-resistant polymer membranes could enable higher yields of therapeutic proteins in the pharmaceutical industry. When I'm not running experiments or coding, you can find me playing trumpet, honing my chess skills, or reading.</p>
<p style="font-size:20px">If you'd like to talk about any of these areas, don't hesitate to reach out! I'm always looking for new challenges.</p>
